\section{Motivation and Background}
With increasing penetration of Electric Vehicles (EVs), distribution transformers face potential thermal overload risks. This project tackles the problem of scheduling EV charging in a way that: • Respects transformer thermal capacity limits (Upper Level), • Allows flexible EV charging while satisfying household energy demand (Lower Level).


\section{Summary}

This project explores Host Capacity Management by transforming a bilevel optimization problem into a single-level optimization problem. The original formulation considers an upper-level decision maker managing transformer capacity and a lower-level model representing the flexible charging behavior of electric vehicle (EV) users. The bilevel model is reformulated into a single-level problem using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.
